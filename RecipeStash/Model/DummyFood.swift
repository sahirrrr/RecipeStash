Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Season both sides of each chicken breast with seasoned salt and a pinch of pepper.

Add the chicken to the skillet and cook for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.

While the chicken is cooking, bring a large pot of water to a boil.

Season the boiling water with a few generous pinches of kosher salt.

Add the pasta and give it a stir. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, about 12 minutes.

Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining the pasta.

Remove the chicken from the pan and transfer it to a cutting board; allow it to rest.

Turn the heat down to medium and dd the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and olive oil to the same pan you used to cook the chicken.

Add the veggies (minus the garlic) and red pepper flakes to the pan and stir to coat with the oil and butter (refrain from seasoning with salt until the veggies are finished browning).

Cook, stirring often, until the veggies are tender, about 5 minutes.

Add the garlic and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to the pan and cook for 1 minute.

Deglaze the pan with the white wine. Continue to cook until the wine has reduced by half, about 3 minutes.

Stir in the milk, heavy cream, and reserved pasta water.

Bring the mixture to a gentle boil and allow to simmer and reduce for 2-3 minutes.

Turn off the heat and add the Parmesan cheese and cooked pasta.

Season with salt and pepper to taste.Garnish with Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley, if desired.

The day before you want to make the dish, scatter half the salt, half the garlic and half of the herbs over the base of a small shallow dish.

Lay the duck legs, skin-side up, on top, then scatter over the remaining salt, garlic and herbs.

Cover the duck and refrigerate overnight.

This can be done up to 2 days ahead.

Pour the wine into a saucepan that will snugly fit the duck legs in a single layer.

Brush the salt off the duck legs and place them, skin-side down, in the wine.

Cover the pan with a lid and place over a medium heat.

As soon as the wine starts to bubble, turn the heat down to the lowest setting and cook for 2 hours, checking occasionally that the liquid is just barely simmering.

(If you own a heat diffuser, it would be good to use it here.)

After 2 hours, the duck legs should be submerged in their own fat and the meat should feel incredibly tender when prodded.
Leave to cool.

The duck legs are now cooked and can be eaten immediately – or you can follow the next step if you like them crisp.

If you are preparing ahead, pack the duck legs tightly into a plastic container or jar and pour over the fat, but not the liquid at the bottom of the pan.

Cover and leave in the fridge for up to a month, or freeze for up to 3 months.

The liquid you are left with makes a tasty gravy, which can be chilled or frozen until needed.

To reheat and crisp up the duck legs, heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.

Remove the legs from the fat and place them, skin-side down, in an ovenproof frying pan.

Roast for 30-40 mins, turning halfway through, until brown and crisp.

Serve with the reheated gravy, a crisp salad and some crisp golden ptoatoes.
